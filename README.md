CSTII-Ariana
============

This repository served as the primary hosting and development platform for my final-year project for Part II of the Computer Science Tripos.

Development of this repository has ceased, and its final state is exactly as submitted. It is retained solely for the purposes of keeping a few relevant links alive. The accompanying dissertation [has its own repository](https://github.com/PetarV-/CSTII-Dissertation).

The code contained here served as the basis for the [muxstep](https://github.com/PetarV-/muxstep) library, which has augmented the original implementation with several improvements, extensions, generalisations and bugfixes. It is also still being actively developed.
